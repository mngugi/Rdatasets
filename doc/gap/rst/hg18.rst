   .. rubric:: Description
      :name: description

   These are internal functions.

   g2a.c is the C version of g2c.

   gc.control is used by gc.em().

   gcode is as a2g.

   grec2g is undocumented.

   HapDesign and HapFreqSE both accept a ``haplo.em`` object to derieve
   a design/dosage matrix and standard error of haplotype frequency
   estimates. The former is appropriate for haplotype trend regression
   (HTR), e.g., within the generalized linear model (GLM) framework to
   be equivllant to a formal approach as implemented in the package
   haplo.stats and hap.score. However, they are expected to be
   compatible with objects from gc.em() ``gc.em`` and ``hap.em``. The
   two functions are included as courtesy of Prof Andrea Foulkes from
   the useR!2008 tutorial.

   hap.score.glm, hap.score.podds are used by hap.score().

   invlogit, inverse logit transformation.

   is.miss is undocumented.

   k obtains 1st and 2nd order culumants for correlation coefficient.

   m2plem is an experimental function for PLEM format.

   makeRLEplot for RLE plot.

   sun3d is for 3D Manhattan plot according to Sun, et al. (2018).

   micombine is used to combine imputation results.

   plem2m is also experimental for PLEM format.

   ReadGRMPLINK is a function to read PLINK PI_HAT as a genomic
   relationship matrix.

   ReadGRMPCA is a function to read .eigenval and .eigenvec files from
   gcta â€“pca.

   revhap recovers the allele indices for a given haplotype ID in a
   multiallelic system.

   revhap.i is similar to revhap.

   solve.skol is a function used by tscc.

   toETDT a function used to experiment with ETDT.

   ungcode recovers alleles from genotype(s).

   VR is a utility function for calculating variance of a ratio.

   weighted.median is a function for obtaining weighted median with
   interpolation.

   WriteGRMSAS is a utility function to write a GRM object to SAS PROCs
   MIXED/GLIMMIX ldata.

   x2 is a simple chi-squared test of two proportions.

   z is a normal z-test of two proportions used by tscc.
